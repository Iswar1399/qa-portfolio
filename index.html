  <!-- ABOUT ME -->
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Senior QA Engineer with over 4 years of experience in testing and
    automating e-commerce applications. I have worked extensively across
    both manual and automation testing, validating critical business flows
    such as login, product selection, order placement, payment validation,
    and delivery tracking.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have designed, enhanced, and maintained scalable Selenium automation
    frameworks using Java, TestNG, and Maven, following Page Object Model
    (POM) principles. I have automated end-to-end UI workflows, performed
    API validations using Postman and basic Rest Assured, and integrated
    CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins to support continuous testing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond execution, I have taken ownership of test planning, regression
    strategy, automation stability, and release sign-off activities. I have
    reviewed test cases, improved automation reliability, and collaborated
    closely with developers, product owners, and junior QA members to
    ensure high-quality and timely releases.

  <!-- JENKINS SECTION -->
  <h2>CI/CD – Jenkins Pipeline</h2>

  <p>
    Implemented Jenkins-based CI/CD pipelines to support continuous testing.
    Jenkins pulls source code from GitHub, executes Maven-driven Selenium
    automation suites, and validates test results on each pipeline run,
    enabling faster feedback and improved release quality.
