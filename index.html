  <p><strong>QA / SDET | Automation Engineer</strong></p>

  <!-- ABOUT ME -->
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a QA Engineer with hands-on experience in testing and automating
    e-commerce applications. I have worked on both manual and automation
    testing, covering critical business flows such as login, product
    selection, order placement, payment validation, and delivery tracking.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the automation side, I have designed and developed a Java-based
    Selenium automation framework using TestNG and Maven, following the
    Page Object Model (POM). I have automated end-to-end UI workflows,
    performed API validations using Postman and basic Rest Assured,
    and integrated CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am experienced in writing test scenarios and test cases, executing
    regression cycles, logging and tracking defects, and collaborating
    closely with developers and product teams to ensure high-quality
    releases.
  </p>

  <!-- JENKINS SECTION -->
  <h2>CI/CD – Jenkins Pipeline</h2>

  <p>
    Integrated Jenkins with the automation framework to enable continuous
    integration. Jenkins pulls the source code from GitHub, executes
    Maven-based Selenium automation tests, and validates test results
    on each pipeline run.
